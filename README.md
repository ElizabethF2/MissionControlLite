# Mission Control Lite

Mission Control Lite is a streamlined, lightweight version of [Mission Control](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/MissionControl) designed for secure and efficient remote command execution. Built with ultra-low resource usage in mind (under 800 kb when idle), it offers a cross-platform, highly modular architecture that makes customization simple. By leveraging the Mission Control bus as a relay, it works seamlessly behind firewalls and without port forwarding, even if the server changes networks. Mission Control Lite can automatically detect and attempt to fix network outages (e.g. by resetting network adapters or rebooting devices), while also keeping these recovery actions fully customizable. Security is a core focus: by default, commands are restricted to a user-defined list, traffic is encrypted end-to-end with SSL and AES, and the system can run with limited permissions or inside a container or sandbox for added protection.
